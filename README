pyTiles

A template framework that will help create a consistent layout by defining page
fragments which can be assembled into a complete page at runtime.

This is not yet another template engine, pyTiles is a layer between your application
code and template engine.

Features

* Template inheritance
* Use your favorite template engine(s) (Yes, can be more than one)
* Assign roles to templates and attributes to control visibility
* Add view preparation functions to templates
* Flexible configuration, customizable tiling types

pyTiles is comparable to Apache Tiles.
